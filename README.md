    enemy max health and particle effects.
  - Settings are written to a file upon leaving the settings menu.
  - Settings will be loaded when the game starts, default will be
    loaded if there is an issue with the saved txt file.
- Player health
  - the player can now die and is indicated by a health bar in the
    top corner, this has taken the position of enemies passed and
    bullets used but i will add those into a "stats" menu entry.
- Game over
  - A game over menu has been made and will allow the player to 
    reset the game, return to the main menu or quit the game.
- Notes 
  - Notes now have an individual timer and will be removed after
    roughly 1.5 seconds, this change has been made due to notes
    stacking up and not leaving the screen for a long time when
    many enimies are killed at once.
